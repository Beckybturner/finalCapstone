Capstone Project:
This jupyter notebook reads amazon reviews, removing stop words, tokenizing and lemmatizing the words in each review, 
in order to work out the sentiment of each review (whether it's positive or negative). 
This is done using SpaCy to do NLP and polarization with TextBlob.

Installation:
Install these packages through pip - SpaCy, Pandas, spacytextblob.spacytextblob
